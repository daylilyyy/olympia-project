    name: "Arnold Schwarzenegger",
    korName: "Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger",
    birth: "July 30, 1947",
    nationality: "Austria → United States",
    height: "188cm",
    weight: "118kg",
    overview: `An American actor, bodybuilder, and politician.\n. Originally from Austria, he became the greatest bodybuilder of all time since he moved to the U.\nS.\n stage in 1968, the headquarters of bodybuilding, and became a super action star with many action movies besides his signature film Terminator.\n. His popularity later helped him enter politics and serve as governor of California, becoming an iconic figure of the American dream.\n. He was like that when he was a bodybuilder when he was a sportsman, and even today, decades after retirement, he is called the best bodybuilder in history.\n. Not only his bodybuilding career, but he also spread and popularized the sport itself, called bodybuilding, which was unfamiliar to people at the time.\n. Although he is better known as a movie star to Koreans, his image as a bodybuilder remains strong in the United States, where weight training was popularized relatively early due to these achievements.\n. Anyone who started exercising at least once saw his photo and grabbed Babel and Dumbell, and many bodybuilders from the generation after Arnold also began exercising as an idol from a young age, and even Eddie Hall, who works as a strongman who has more room for less relevance due to the different direction of exercise from bodybuilding, hangs a cloth printed with Arnold in his personal luggage, so its symbolism is legendary.\n. He was a superstar who dominated Hollywood in the 1980s and 1990s and represented Hollywood with Sylvester Stallone, and his popularity and influence were enormous, and the name Arnold Schwarzenegger was like a box office brand.\n. There are even a number of his major films that have been hit hard by a franchise series or remade, and he has appeared in many great works.\n.`,

    overview:
      "A legendary bodybuilder who dominated the 1990s.\n. A six-time Mr.\nOlympia winner and only a few white bodybuilders to ever win Olympia.\n. A significant figure in bodybuilding history, not only because of this tremendous award-winning experience, but also because of the changes in the bodybuilding world he brought or the influence of his training style.\n. He spent his childhood as a British bodybuilder very unfortunate, and at the age of 13, his father died of cancer and lived with his single mother.\n. When he was young, he wandered a lot, so he was a problem enough to go to juvenile detention centers.\n. However, after juvenile detention, he started bodybuilding at 18, and won the British Championship five years after training, culminating in the amateur stage.\n. Afterwards, he made his professional debut by winning second place at the Night of Champions in 1990.\n. The following year, in 1991, he gained a professional career and won the same competition, before entering the Olympia Games, where Lee Haney, then the champion at the time, finished second, although he was lagging behind Lee Haney's record of eighth win, the most ever.\n. In 1992, when Lee Haney retired, he finally won first place in Olympia, becoming the world's best bodybuilder.\n.",

      "Ronnie Coleman has been loved for his eight consecutive wins at Mr.\nOlympia and his ultra-high-weight athletic style.\n. Since Dorian Yates' monstrousness has become a trend in the professional bodybuilding industry since the 1990s, he has peaked in terms of enormity and conditioning, and was nicknamed Ronisaurus because he reminds people of dinosaurs.\n. He is a bodybuilder who fits the image better than anyone else in terms of muscle mass that comes to mind when it comes to bodybuilders and muscle mass that ordinary people can't even think of.\n. He won awards during his heyday, but he has been loved for his unique characteristics such as shouting during training sessions.\n. He is the eighth consecutive winner of Mr.\nOlympia, tying for first in the number of wins in history with Lee Haney.\n. He has nearly 7 million followers on Instagram.\n.",
